========

This website is school project made to be like an inventory of medicines in a pharmaceutical shop.
Basically CRUD (inventory, suppliers, customer sales, users)

It also contains cashier module, wherein customers can buy products found in the inventory, 
price already computed, and lastly, can issue a receipt (pdf format).

However, this website doesn't have much client and server side validation.

Feel free to explore. Thanks!
